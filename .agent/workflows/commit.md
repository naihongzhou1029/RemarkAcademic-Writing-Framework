description: Commit staged changes with bilingual, structured messages as per AGENTS.md
---

1. Ensure the changes you want to commit are staged. If not, stage them now using `git add`.
2. Analyze the staged changes to identify major updates and detailed rationale.
3. Compose a commit message following the exact conventions defined in `AGENTS.md`. 
   - Before drafting, verify the specifically required structure, language requirements (e.g., bilingual), and formatting details currently listed in `AGENTS.md`.

4. Commit the changes using the generated message.
   - Example command: `git commit -m "title" -m "body"` or use a temporary file if the message is complex.
5. Provide the user with a summary of the commit.
